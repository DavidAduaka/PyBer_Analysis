# PyBer_Analysis

## Challenge Overview
V. Isualize found our work so useful that they neeed extra data visualizations to help improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods. This time around they need us to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. 

## Resources 
- Data Source: city_data.csv, ride_data.csv, PyBer_ride_data.csv
- Software: Anaconda 4.10.1, Jupyter Notebook 6.4.0

## Results
Based on the miltiple-line graph we can see Fare data follows a trend that most would assume it would. With Urban city types, then surburban, then rural. Some would expect surburban city types would have the lowest fares due to people having transportation of their own, but people have more disposible capital than people who live in rural areas and travel more frequently.  

## Challenge Summary 
One Business Reccomendation to the CEO would be to pre-pay drivers for a week and send them to rural areas and see how much they make, so he can devise a plan to increase revenue in those city types.
