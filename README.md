# PyBer_Analysis

## Challenge Overview
V. Isualize found our work so useful that they neeed extra data visualizations to help improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods. This time around they need us to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.
